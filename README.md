# freecodecamptributepage

I made this website after I started working on the tribute page for the freecodecamp responsive web design cert. I just thought I'd make it about this author and I took it a little further, taking information from the official Ghent University website to act as the content on the page.

Yeah, it looks like my resume/portfolio page. So what?

That's right. That's what I thought. Yeah, keep walking.
